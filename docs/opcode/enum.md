# Result: If conditions are met then start to perform self enumeration. A RTR CAN frame is sent. The module must wait 100ms for other modules to respond with a zero length data frame containing their CANID. After 100ms the module shall select an unused CANID in the range 1..127. If no CANIDs are available then send CMDERR(7).
